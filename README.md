## Systematic Buzz Phrase Projector


</div>

### Description

The Systematic Buzz Phrase Projector creates technical

sounding phrases that you can drop into any report you may

be writing. You'll sound like you really know your stuff, the

people reading the report won't have the slightest idea what

your talking about but surely won't admit it! Could be a

good tool to use on pointy haired boss types! I wrote this

project for a class so it's not real snazzy, just something

fun. I'd appreciate any comments/suggestions for

improvements. Please send any flames to: null/dev@efn.org
 
### More Info
 
Returns a technical sounding phrase you can put into a report!

Maybe a job promotion cuz your boss thinks you know what

you're talking about!
